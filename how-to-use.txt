The app is designed keeping in mind mobile first design. So it looks better on a mobile viewport :P.
The only responsive breakpoint is ipad viewport which is 768px.
Some of the addresses I have tested and the app works well on are

1) 468 Kansas Street, San Francisco, CA, USA (gives Rent zestimate)
2) 810 Buchanan Street, San Francisco, CA, USA(calculates Rent zestimate from zestimate)
3) 10675 Baxter Ave, Los Altos, CA (gives Rent zestimate)
4) 1 Bluxome St, San Francisco, CA (gives Rent zestimate)

This app might not work well for addresses with a street2(apt no/suite no) since google autocomplete doesn't support it and it was adding more scope.

Also the overall work on this app was in between 24-36 dev hours, this includes dev setup, feature build and deployment to heroku.

This app is deployed on a live env to heroku on https://yt-rent-estimate.herokuapp.com

Also I had to deviate the layout on desktop viewport from the one given in requirements because i thought this was a better UX keeping in mind my design.

Please let me know if I can answer any other questions.
